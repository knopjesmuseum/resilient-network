Resilient Network
=================
An interactive installation that challenges people to light up lamps using a so called resilient network. There are multiple lamps, which represent consumers, a generator the producer, and wires. The visitor is challenged to power the lamps using the wires. Every lamp and generator has 3 outlets, this enables visitors to create a network. The visitor can then test their design by pressing a big button. This releases a crisis (shocks) on the network and one random connection (wire) will fall down. When there is no redundancy in the system, lamps that where depending on that connection lose their access to power and go out. When a light is without power it can't hold the wires and a part of the network will physically collapse. The challenge is to design a resilient network that can absorb the shocks and leave all the lights on.
